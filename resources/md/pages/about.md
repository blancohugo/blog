## Hello!

I'm Hugo Blanco, based in São Paulo, Brazil. Nice to meet you! :)

I'm a developer and software analyst, with almost 10 years of experience in web development technologies, like **PHP** and **NodeJS**.

Actively contributed to high-scale projects, from start to finish - from infrastructure and service configuration to development, cache optimization, and production release.

I’ve worked with some other programming languages and scopes, different from web development, such as mobile development with **Xamarin** and games development with **Unity3D**.

I’m always looking to contribute actively with the teams, sharing knowledge, bringing suggestions and ideas, but also always open to feedback and changes of mindset.
