## Blog

I started to develop this blog many months ago, with the intention of exploring Mezzio, by Laminas, a bit more, and ended up moving forward, in order to share my recent studies in the form of articles.

This blog was initially developed with PHP 7.3, but right before its publication it was adapted to PHP 8. This application is published on Heroku and you can find the source file [on Github](https://github.com/blancohugo/blog).

## Content

Expect to see lots of software-related content, such as:
- Development of back-end and front-end applications
- Development processes
- Software architecture
- High performance distributed systems

Be very welcome. Hope you enjoy the content!
